# OSAL — Operating System Abstraction Layer

A portable, layered abstraction over real-time and general-purpose operating
systems for Rust applications.

## Overview

OSAL provides a unified API for developing multi-platform embedded and
real-time applications. Write your application logic once and run it
across different platforms by switching the backend.

**Legend:**
- ✓ — Implemented and tested
- API only — Trait defined, no backend implementation
- sys only — Low-level sys wrapper exists, no trait impl yet
- Partial — Core semantics implemented, blocking deferred
- Deferred — Planned for future phase
- skeleton — Contract test skeleton exists, not enabled
- — — Not applicable to this layer

## Architecture

OSAL uses a layered crate architecture:

```
Application
    ↓
osal (facade)          ← what you depend on
    ↓
osal-api               ← public traits and types
    ↓
osal-shared + osal-portable  ← shared logic and helpers
    ↓
osal-backend-*         ← platform-specific implementations
    ↓
osal-bsp + osal-bsp-*  ← board support packages
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details.

## Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
osal = "0.1"                                         # POSIX (default)
osal = { version = "0.1", default-features = false,
         features = ["backend-mock"] }               # Mock
```

```rust
use osal::prelude::*;
use core::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // Create a queue
    let q = Queue::new(8, 4).unwrap();

    // Send a message
    q.send(&1u32.to_le_bytes(), Timeout::NoWait).unwrap();

    // Receive it
    let mut buf = [0u8; 4];
    q.recv(&mut buf, Timeout::NoWait).unwrap();
}
```

## Status

**P0 complete: Queue vertical slice stabilized. P1 in progress: Mutex vertical slice.**

POSIX Queue, Mock Queue, POSIX Mutex, and Mock Mutex are implemented
and tested. Contract tests split into Core (all backends) and Blocking
(POSIX only). ISR operations deferred to FreeRTOS phase.

CI enforces format, clippy, tests, docs, and feature matrix checks.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent API changes.
