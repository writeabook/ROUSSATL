# Changelog

## P6D — POSIX Backend Conformance Closure (2026-07-22) — Completed

### Verified

- Confirmed that the POSIX backend implements the complete current
  non-deferred `osal-api` trait surface: Queue, Mutex,
  CountingSemaphore, BinarySemaphore, Clock, Timer, System, Task,
  and TaskBuilder.
- No `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, placeholder `panic!()`, or
  unconditional `Error::Unsupported` in any POSIX trait method.
- All trait methods have contract test coverage (shared contracts
  or backend-specific tests).
- POSIX backend tests, facade tests, and full workspace tests pass.
- Runtime lifecycle verified: init → create objects → shutdown →
  re-init cycle works correctly with active-object gating.

### Changed

- Updated capability matrix: POSIX column marked Validated for all
  current non-deferred capabilities.
- Updated README project status to reflect P6D completion.

### Deferred (unchanged)

- Advanced task controls (cancellation, suspend/resume, real priority
  scheduling, stack watermark).
- ISR extension traits.
- FreeRTOS backend.
- Production BSP implementation.

## P6C — Documentation Baseline Freeze (2026-07-22) — Completed

### Changed

- Reconciled README status with P6A/P6B implementation progress.
  Replaced "P0-P5 complete" with current P6B milestone and
  capability matrix using Validated/Implemented/Foundation/Deferred
  terminology.
- Defined documentation source-of-truth hierarchy: code >
  behavior-contract > ADRs > architecture > foundation slices >
  README > CHANGELOG.
- Aligned `architecture.md` runtime model and allocation
  description with `behavior-contract.md` §2. Removed `alloc`
  as a Cargo feature; clarified `std` is reserved for future
  host-only integrations.
- Split architecture diagrams into current implementation and
  target extension. Added crate maturity labels.
- Marked BSP, FreeRTOS, ISR extensions, and EventFlags as
  explicitly Deferred or Planned.
- Added `docs/documentation-policy.md` with update triggers,
  status terminology, and ADR rules.

### Fixed

- Semaphore constructor parameter validation now precedes runtime
  lease acquisition (ADR 0019 §6).
- Resolved rustdoc intra-doc links in runtime module documentation.

## P6B — Runtime Lifecycle (2026-07-21) — Completed

### Added

- ADR 0014: Backend and BSP Responsibility Boundary (semantic ownership
  vs primitive provider, composition rules, init/shutdown ordering).
- ADR 0015: Runtime Lifecycle (four-state cycle, transactional guards,
  failure-atomic hooks, re-initialisable after shutdown).
- ADR 0016: Linearizable Runtime Lease Accounting (single AtomicUsize
  packing state + count, supersedes ADR 0015 double-check algorithm).
- `RuntimeState` enum in `osal-api` (`Uninitialized`, `Initializing`,
  `Running`, `ShuttingDown`).
- `RuntimeLifecycle` in `osal-shared` with transactional `initialize`/
  `shutdown` guards and `RuntimeLease` double-count for object tracking.
- `Error::Busy` (runtime in use or lifecycle transition in progress).
- 22 RuntimeLifecycle unit tests (20 state-machine + 2 concurrency).
  38 total `osal-shared` unit tests.
- RuntimeLease-based active-object accounting.
- `osal-bsp` dependency on `osal-api` removed per ADR 0014.
- Updated architecture docs and behavior contract error table.

## P6A — Task Semantic Alignment (2026-07-20)

### Breaking changes

- **`Task::current()` returns `Option<TaskHandle>`** instead of `Handle`.
  `None` outside an OSAL-created task context (no more magic-zero sentinel).
- **`Task::handle()` returns `TaskHandle`** (`NonZeroUsize` wrapper) instead
  of bare `Handle`.
- **`count()` semantics changed**: counts live entry executions, not handle
  references. Completed tasks whose handle still exists are not counted.
- **Builder validation unified**: `validate_task_config()` in `osal-shared`.
  Empty name is valid; embedded NUL, >31 bytes, zero stack → `InvalidParameter`.
  Setters no longer silently clamp invalid values.
- **`Error::NotInitialized` removed from `join()`** documentation (API cannot
  produce an unstarted `Task`).

### Added

- `TaskHandle` type (`NonZeroUsize`, `Debug`, `Clone`, `Copy`, `Eq`, `Hash`).
- `LiveTaskToken` RAII guard: increments on entry start, decrements on return.
  Correctly rolls back on `pthread_create` failure or Mock entry panic.
- Backend-local `current()` identity via `thread_local!` (POSIX and Mock).
- 17 `TaskCoreContract` tests shared by both backends.
- POSIX concurrency tests: barrier-based three-task concurrency, concurrent join.
- POSIX `pthread_attr_setstacksize` with explicit error handling.
- Mock panic rollback tests (TLS and count restoration on unwind).
- Count-test serialisation lock in testkit.

### Fixed

- Trampoline order: `drop(live_token)` *before* `set_finished()` so NoWait
  pollers see the correct count immediately.
- POSIX `do_pthread_join`: non-consuming `&self` join preserves the pthread
  handle on failure for retry.
- NoWait no longer calls `pthread_join` (blocking); it returns cached code
  directly from `Finished` or `Joined` state.

### Changed

- Behavior contract §8 Task and test matrix fully rewritten.
- Mock no longer claims concurrent scheduling or suspend/resume.
- Architecture public types list includes `TaskHandle`.
- ADR 0013 records all design decisions.

## P5 — Task Foundation Slice (2026-07-07)

### Added

- Mock task implementation (synchronous execution in `spawn()`).
- POSIX pthread-based task implementation with completion-state machine
  (`Running → Finished → Joining → Joined`).
- Task smoke contract tests (5 tests) for both Mock and POSIX backends.
- POSIX task timeout join tests.
- Facade `Task` and `TaskBuilder` aliases.
- Backend-agnostic `task` facade example.

### Notes

- Task entry functions return `()`. Normal return maps to
  `ExitCode::SUCCESS`.
- `drop` on a `Task` handle does **not** cancel the task.
- Repeated `join()` returns the cached exit code immediately.
- POSIX timeout join uses `pthread_cond_timedwait` on backend
  completion state rather than non-portable `pthread_timedjoin_np`.
- Mock task execution is synchronous in this foundation slice
  (no mock scheduler).
- Priority is stored and reported; scheduling effect is
  backend-specific.

### Deferred

- Cancellation, suspend/resume, real priority scheduling, CPU
  affinity, stack watermark, deterministic mock scheduler,
  FreeRTOS task mapping.

## P4 — System Foundation Slice (2026-07-07)

### Added

- `MockSystem` with atomic nesting counter for critical sections.
- `PosixSystem` with process-local recursive `pthread_mutex_t`.
- `sys::recursive_mutex` wrapper (`PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE`).
- `SystemFactory` in testkit; 5 system contract tests (heap_free,
  enter_critical, guard-drop re-entry, nesting, reverse drop order).
- `System` facade alias and `System` trait in `osal::prelude`.
- Backend-agnostic `system` facade example.
- `critical_depth_for_test()` helper exposed on Mock for stabilisation tests.

### Notes

- `heap_free()` returns `usize::MAX` for both Mock and POSIX backends.
  Real heap introspection is deferred to the BSP/resource phase.
- POSIX critical sections use a process-local recursive mutex
  (separate from the non-recursive `PosixMutex` used by `Mutex<T>`).
- Mock critical sections model nested entry/exit as an atomic counter
  for deterministic single-context tests.
- Critical sections support nesting; the outermost guard drop fully
  exits.

## P2 — Semaphore Foundation Slice (2026-07-06)

### Added

- `CountingSemaphore` trait with `acquire`/`release`/`max_count`/`count`.
- `BinarySemaphore` trait with `acquire`/`release`/`is_signaled`.
- ADR 0008: ISR Extension Model (ISR removed from core traits).
- `CountingSemaphoreState` portable state machine in `osal-portable`.
- `MockCountingSemaphore` (Rc) and `MockBinarySemaphore` (delegation).
- `PosixCountingSemaphore` (Arc, mutex+condvar, monotonic clock).
- `PosixBinarySemaphore` (delegates to PosixCountingSemaphore).
- 14 CountingCore + 9 BinaryCore contract tests.
- 8 POSIX blocking contract tests (generic over SemaphoreFactory).
- `mock_semaphore` and `posix_semaphore` examples.
- `docs/semaphore-foundation-slice.md`.

### Changed

- **ISR removed from core semaphore traits** (matching Queue P0).
- **`count()` returns `Result<u32>`** (matching Queue `len()`).
- **`is_acquired()` → `is_signaled() -> Result<bool>`**.
- `max_count()` is immutable cached value (no lock).
- Behavior contract §10 fully updated.

## P1.1 — Mutex Correctness Stabilization (2026-07-06)

### Changed (Breaking)

- **`Mutex<T>` is now non-recursive.** Re-locking while a guard is
  alive returns `Error::LockFailed`. The previous recursive + `DerefMut`
  combination was unsound (aliased `&mut T`). Recursive locking is
  deferred to a future `RecursiveMutex` type.

### Fixed

- **Memory safety**: Mock `MockMutexInner` no longer has `unsafe impl
  Send/Sync`. Only one guard can exist at a time.
- **Handle model**: POSIX `PosixMutexImpl<T>` now uses
  `Arc<PosixMutexInner<T>>` and implements `Clone` per ADR 0006.
- **Clock correctness**: POSIX `timed_lock` now uses monotonic clock
  (`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` + `try_lock` loop) instead of
  `pthread_mutex_timedlock` which may use `CLOCK_REALTIME`.
- **Sys mutex type**: `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE` → `PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK`.
- **Contract tests**: Removed recursive tests; added non-recursive tests
  (`no_second_guard`, `clone_shares_state`, `drop_clone_keeps_alive`).

### Added

- ADR 0007: Mutex Access Model (non-recursive, single guard).
- `monotonic_now_raw()`, `nanosleep()`, `timespec_ge()` helpers in
  `sys/time.rs`.

## P1 — Mutex Vertical Slice (2026-07-06)

### Added

- ADR 0006: Object Handle Model (strong typed handles, no global ID registry).
- `Mutex<T>` backend implementations:
  - `MockMutex<T>` (`Rc` + `UnsafeCell` + `Cell<usize>`, recursive).
  - `PosixMutexImpl<T>` (`PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE`, `try_lock`, `timed_lock`).
- `MutexCoreContract`: 8 tests covering creation, lock/unlock, recursive,
  guard semantics.
- `MutexBlockingContract`: 3 cross-thread tests (POSIX only).
- `mock_mutex` and `posix_mutex` examples.
- `docs/mutex-foundation-slice.md` — architecture, components, deferred items.

### Changed

- `sys/mutex.rs`: switched from `PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK` to
  `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE`.
- `sys/mutex.rs`: added `try_lock()` and `timed_lock()` methods.
- `behavior-contract.md`: fixed POSIX table (Mutex<T> → RECURSIVE);
  added timeout table, error mapping, non-requirements.
- README Mutex row updated from "API only" to fully implemented.
- `object-lifetime.md`: added Guard concept and four-layer object model.

### Fixed

- `docs/queue-foundation-slice.md`: removed "POSIX Queue implementation"
  from Intentionally Deferred; updated contract test counts; updated
  Status to Complete.

## P0 — Queue Vertical Slice Stabilization (2026-07-03)

### Added

- ADRs: error precedence, queue close semantics, ISR API policy, query
  method policy, mock runtime model.
- `Error::Overflow` now covers `capacity * msg_size` overflow.
- Error precedence rules: `InvalidMessageSize` > `QueueClosed` >
  `QueueFull`/`QueueEmpty` > `Timeout` > `Internal`.
- `After(Duration::ZERO)` semantics: resource available → success,
  unavailable → `Error::Timeout`.
- `ByteQueue::is_closed()` public accessor.
- Contract tests split into `QueueCoreContract` and `QueueBlockingContract`.
- Error precedence contract tests.
- CI workflow: format, clippy, test, docs, feature guards.

### Changed

- **`Queue::close()`**: return type `()` → `Result<()>`.
- **`Queue::len()`**: return type `usize` → `Result<usize>`.
- **`Queue::is_empty()`**: return type `bool` → `Result<bool>`.
- **`Queue::is_full()`**: return type `bool` → `Result<bool>`.
- `Queue::capacity()` and `Queue::msg_size()` are now documented as
  non-fallible (fixed at construction).
- `ByteQueue::new()` uses `checked_mul` and `try_reserve_exact` instead
  of the `vec![]` macro; returns `Error::Overflow` on overflow and
  `Error::OutOfMemory` on allocation failure.
- `ByteQueue::try_send()`: error precedence changed — checks
  `InvalidMessageSize` before `QueueClosed`.
- POSIX `QueueInner`: removed duplicate `closed` flag; uses
  `ByteQueue.is_closed()` as sole source.
- POSIX `QueueInner`: cached `capacity` and `message_size` for
  lock-free access.
- POSIX `send()`/`recv()`: no longer double-lock for size validation.
- POSIX `close()`: checks `is_closed()` for idempotency.
- Behavior contract: feature names unified to `backend-posix` /
  `backend-mock`.
- Behavior contract: Semaphore `release()` at max returns
  `Error::Overflow` instead of `Error::InvalidParameter`.
- Contract tests: all error assertions use precise `matches!` with
  exact variant.

### Removed

- **`Queue::isr_send()`** and **`Queue::isr_recv()`** removed from
  core `Queue` trait. ISR operations deferred to future `IsrQueue`
  extension trait.
- ISR methods removed from MockQueue and PosixQueue.
- ISR contract tests (`run_isr_contracts`) removed.
- Behavior contract: ISR descriptions removed from Queue and Mutex
  sections.
- Behavior contract: Mutex `isr_lock()` removed from contract doc
  (never existed in trait).
