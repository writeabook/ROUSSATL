//! Capability-based factory traits for creating OSAL primitives.
//!
//! Each trait focuses on one primitive type. Backends implement only
//! the factories for the primitives they support. This allows Mock
//! to start with `QueueFactory + ClockFactory` without implementing
//! `TaskFactory` or `TimerFactory`.
//!
//! # Backward compatibility
//!
//! [`BackendFactory`] combines all Phase A factories into a single
//! supertrait for existing contract tests. New code should use the
//! individual factories directly.
