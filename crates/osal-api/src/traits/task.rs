/// An independent execution context (thread / RTOS task).
///
/// Tasks are created via a backend-specific builder and started with
/// [`spawn`](TaskBuilder::spawn). Once running, a task can be waited on
/// with [`join`](Task::join).
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// ```text
/// TaskBuilder::new() → .name(...) → .spawn(entry) → Task (Ready)
///                                                        ↓
///                                                   Running
///                                                        ↓
///                                              join() → ExitCode
/// ```
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use osal::prelude::*;
///
/// let task = PosixTaskBuilder::new()
///     .name("worker")
///     .priority(2)
///     .spawn(|| { /* work */ })?;
///
/// let result = task.join(Timeout::Forever)?;
/// assert_eq!(result, ExitCode::SUCCESS);
/// ```
pub trait Task: Sized {
    /// Block until the task exits, or `timeout` expires.
    ///
    /// Returns `Ok(ExitCode)` on successful join.
    /// Returns `Error::Timeout` if the task did not exit in time.
    /// Returns `Error::NotInitialized` if the task was never started.
    ///
    /// Consumes `self`; the handle is invalid after a successful join.
    fn join(self, timeout: Timeout) -> Result<ExitCode>;

    /// Return the opaque handle identifying this task.

    /// Return the handle of the currently executing task.
    fn current() -> Handle;

/// Builder for configuring and spawning a [`Task`].
///
/// Each backend provides a concrete `TaskBuilder` that produces that
/// backend's `Task` type.
///
/// # Defaults
///
/// | Field | Default |
/// |-------|---------|
/// | `name` | `""` |
/// | `stack_size` | `4096` (may be adjusted by backend) |
/// | `priority` | `1` |

/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// let task = PosixTaskBuilder::new()
///     .name("sensor")
///     .stack_size(8192)
///     .priority(3)
///     .spawn(|| sensor_loop())?;
/// ```

    /// NUL bytes.

    ///
    /// The entry function `F` is executed exactly once in the new
    /// task context. It should not panic (panicking aborts the process
    /// on `panic=abort`).

    /// Returns `Error::InvalidParameter` if any builder field is out
    /// of range. Returns `Error::OutOfMemory` if the task cannot be
    /// allocated.
