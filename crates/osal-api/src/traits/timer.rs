//! Timer trait — delayed and periodic callbacks.

//! See [the backend contract](../../../docs/backend-contract.md#11-timer-contract)
//! for the full behavioral specification.

/// Callback type for timer expiration.
///
/// The callback executes in a timer service context (not ISR). It
/// should be short, non-blocking, and must not panic.
pub type TimerCallback = alloc::boxed::Box<dyn Fn() + Send + 'static>;

/// A software timer that invokes a callback after a configurable period.
///
/// Timers start in the **stopped** state. Call [`start`](Timer::start)
/// to begin the countdown.
///
/// # Callback execution
///
/// - **OneShot**: callback fires once, timer stops.
/// - **Periodic**: callback fires, timer automatically reloads.
/// - Callbacks execute outside the timer management lock.
/// - Callbacks execute in a service context (not ISR).
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// use core::time::Duration;
/// use osal::prelude::*;
///
/// let timer = Timer::new(
///     "heartbeat",
///     Duration::from_millis(500),
///     TimerMode::Periodic,
///     Box::new(|| { /* heartbeat */ }),
/// )?;
/// timer.start()?;
/// ```
pub trait Timer: Sized {
    /// Create a new timer in the stopped state.
    ///
    /// `name` is informational (for debugging). `period` is the time
    /// between start/reset and callback execution. `mode` selects
    /// one-shot or periodic behavior.
    ///
    /// Returns `Error::InvalidParameter` if `period` is zero.
    /// Returns `Error::OutOfMemory` on allocation failure.

    /// timer is a no-op.

    /// countdown). Returns `Error::InvalidParameter` if `new_period`
    /// is zero.
