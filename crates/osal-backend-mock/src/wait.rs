//! Deterministic wait outcome model for Mock primitives.
//!
//! Centralizes the timeout → result mapping used by MockQueue,
//! MockSemaphore, etc. Backends with real blocking (POSIX) implement
//! their own wait model; this module serves the Mock backend only.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Each operation (send, recv, acquire) produces a raw result from
//! the underlying data structure (`ByteQueue`, etc.). The wait model
//! maps `Timeout` + raw result → final result according to:
//!
//! | Timeout  | Raw result          | Final result      |
//! |----------|---------------------|-------------------|
//! | NoWait   | any                 | pass through      |
//! | After(_) | QueueFull/QueueEmpty | Error::Timeout    |
//! | After(_) | other               | pass through      |
//! | Forever  | QueueFull/QueueEmpty | Error::Unsupported |
//! | Forever  | other               | pass through      |
